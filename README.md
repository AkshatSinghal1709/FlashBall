# FlashBall
Our team has made a game "FlashBall" using C++ Platform.
The main goal of the player in this game is to make the ball reach the final point by using the control Keys,which are defined as such:
             A key to move ball in LEFT direction.
             W key to move ball in UP direction.
             S key to move ball in DOWN direction.
             D key to move ball in RIGHT direction.
But without hitting the BLOCKS and LINES(which are yellow in colour) that are the obstacles coming in the path.
A route will be displayed which the ball has to follow which consists of obstacles(YELLOW in colour)and also the boundaries(which are BLUE in colour).
The ball will not be able to cross these boundaries as it will be rebounded on hitting the wall/boundaries.
Now if the player hits the obstacle(BLOCKS ,LINES) GAME OVER will appear on screen and game ends.
The game consists of 2 LEVELS .
Only after the player crosses 1st LEVEL he will be able to play the 2nd one.
After crossing the 1st LEVEL , 2nd LEVEL  automatically Starts.
If the player loses in the 2nd LEVEL i.e hits the obstacle by ball he has to start the game again from the beginning i.e 1st LEVEL.
NOTE :- If the player presses any key except the controlling keys while playing a LEVEL the GAME gets OVER by Default.
